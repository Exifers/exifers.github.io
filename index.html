    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>I'm Emmanuel, a software engineer primarly working with Typescript.</p>
    <p>My mantra:
      <ul>
        <li>focus on <b>code quality</b></li>
        <li>use <b>static typing</b> as much as what it can do</li>
        <li>use <em>a lot of</em> <b>assertions</b></li>
        <li>breakdown your codebase using a <b>monorepo</b></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I was previously architect at <a href="https://partoo.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Partoo</a> (25 engineers), and lead in small early-stage startups.</p>
    <p>As a web-design addict I develop <a href="https://compoze.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compoze</a>, a Figma clone that integrates coding capabilities into prototypes, and can turn them into code.</p>
    <p>This blog is for sharing personal advancements and tips I find to make better software.</p>
